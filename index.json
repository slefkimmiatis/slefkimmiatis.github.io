Yet, the observed images of the objects at the micro-scale suffer from two major inherent distortions: the blur caused by the diffraction of light, and the background noise caused by the imperfections of the imaging detectors. The latter is especially severe in fluorescence and in confocal microscopes, which are known for operating at the low photon count with the Poisson noise statistics. Restoration of such images is usually accomplished by image deconvolution, with the nature of the noise statistics taken into account, and by solving an optimization problem given some prior information about the underlying data (i.e., regularization). In this work, we propose a unifying framework of algorithms for Poisson image deblurring and denoising. The algorithms are based on deep learning techniques for the design of learnable regularizers paired with an appropriate optimization scheme. Our extensive experimentation line showcases that the proposed approach achieves superior quality of image reconstruction and beats the solutions that rely on deep learning or on the optimization schemes alone. Moreover, several implementations of the proposed framework demonstrate competitive performance at a low computational complexity, which is of high importance for real-time imaging applications.","tags":null,"title":"Microscopy Image Restoration with Deep Wiener-Kolmogorov filters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

The first two steps are usually related to denoising and demosaicking, where the former aims to reduce noise from the sensor and the latter converts a series of light intensity readings to color images. Modern approaches try to jointly solve these problems, i.e., joint denoising-demosaicking, which is an inherently ill-posed problem given that two-thirds of the intensity information is missing and the rest is perturbed by noise. While there are several machine learning systems that have been recently introduced to solve this problem, the majority of them rely on generic network architectures, which do not explicitly consider the physical image model. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that is inspired by powerful classical image regularization methods, large-scale optimization, and deep learning techniques. Consequently, our derived iterative optimization algorithm, which involves a trainable denoising network, has a transparent and clear interpretation compared with other black-box data driven approaches. Our extensive experimentation line demonstrates that our proposed method outperforms any previous approaches for both noisy and noise-free data across many different datasets. This improvement in reconstruction quality is attributed to the rigorous derivation of an iterative solution and the principled way we design our denoising network architecture, which as a result requires fewer trainable parameters than the current state-of-the-art solution, and furthermore can be efficiently trained by using a significantly smaller number of training data than existing deep demosaicking networks.","tags":null,"title":"Iterative Joint Image Demosaicking and Denoising Using a Residual Denoising Network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

Among the most common ways to deal with such limitations is to rely on burst photography, which nowadays acts as the backbone of all modern smartphone imaging applications. In this work, we focus on the fact that every frame of a burst sequence can be accurately described by a forward (physical) model. This, in turn, allows us to restore a single image of higher quality from a sequence of low-quality images as the solution of an optimization problem. Inspired by an extension of the gradient descent method that can handle non-smooth functions, namely the proximal gradient descent, and modern deep learning techniques, we propose a convolutional iterative network with a transparent architecture. Our network uses a burst of low-quality image frames and is able to produce an output of higher image quality recovering fine details which are not distinguishable in any of the original burst frames. We focus both on the burst photography pipeline as a whole, i.e., burst demosaicking and denoising, as well as on the traditional Gaussian denoising task.

Generally, LLR-based MRI reconstruction techniques operate by dividing the underlying image into a collection of matrices formed from image patches. Each of these matrices is assumed to have low rank due to the inherent correlations among the data, whether along the coil, temporal, or multi-contrast dimensions. The LLR regularization has been successful for various MRI applications, such as parallel imaging and accelerated quantitative parameter mapping. However, a major limitation of most conventional implementations of the LLR regularization is the use of multiple sets of overlapping patches. Although the use of overlapping patches leads to effective shift-invariance, it also results in high-computational load, which limits the practical utility of the LLR regularization for MRI. To circumvent this problem, alternative LLR-based algorithms instead shift a single set of non-overlapping patches at each iteration, thereby achieving shift-invariance and avoiding block artifacts. A novel contribution of this paper is to provide a mathematical framework and justification of LLR regularization with iterative random patch adjustments (LLR-IRPA). This method is compared with a state-of-the-art LLR regularization algorithm based on overlapping patches, and it is shown experimentally that results are similar but with the advantage of much reduced computational load. We also present theoretical results demonstrating the effective shift invariance of the LLR-IRPA approach, and we show reconstruction examples and comparisons in both retrospectively and prospectively undersampled MRI acquisitions, and in T1 parameter mapping.","tags":null,"title":"Improved Computational Efficiency of Locally Low Rank MRI Reconstruction Using Iterative Random Patch Adjustments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E.

For the case of the mean square error (MSE) criterion, the proposed method is an improvement of the existing McCowan post-filter, which under the assumption of a known noise field coherence function uses the auto- and cross-spectral densities of the microphone array noisy inputs to estimate the Wiener post-filter transfer function. In contrast to McCowan post-filter, the proposed method takes into account the noise reduction performed by the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamformer and obtains a more accurate estimation of the noise spectral density. Furthermore, the proposed estimation approach is general and can be used for the derivation of both linear and nonlinear microphone array post-filters, according to the utilized enhancement criterion. In experiments with real noise multichannel recordings the proposed technique has shown to obtain a significant gain over the other studied methods in terms of five different objective speech quality measures.","tags":["Nonlinear","Noise reduction","Speech enhancement","Microphone array","Post-filter","Complex coherence"],"title":"A generalized estimation approach for linear and nonlinear microphone array post-filters","type":"publication"}]
